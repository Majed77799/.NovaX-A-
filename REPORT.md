### NovaX Final UI/UX + Code Audit

- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router, Edge runtime), PWA enabled, Expo mobile app.
- Type: Monorepo with shared `@repo/ai` and `@repo/shared` packages.

#### Changes applied

- Design tokens: Added CSS variables for colors, spacing, radius, shadow, and base font size in `apps/web/app/globals.css`.
- Typography: Ensured Urbanist via `next/font`; standardized `--font-urbanist` usage.
- Dark mode: Implemented `data-theme` tokens and mappings; preserved system default and added Settings toggle persistence.
- Reduced motion: Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` safeguard.
- Focus states: Added `:focus-visible` for keyboard navigation.
- Micro-interactions: Button hover/active transitions; bubble fade-in.
- Responsiveness: Mobile spacing tweaks, bubble width adjustments.
- Accessibility: ARIA roles for log/toolbar/orb, labels and titles for buttons, improved nav semantics.
- Navigation: Added top nav to `layout.tsx` for Home/Explore/Settings.
- Branding: Rebranded to NovaX across layout metadata, manifest, mobile app, input placeholders, and system prompt.
- PWA/Offline: Added Retry link on offline page.
- Performance: Long-lived cache headers for TTS audio; remote templates fetch cached with revalidate; consistent `transform` animations.
- Code hygiene: No broken imports found; removed no code but flagged unused deps below.

#### Accessibility status

- Keyboard: tabbable controls and visible focus rings.
- Screen readers: Live region for chat, roles on key UI, labels for inputs and buttons.
- Dark mode: Opt-in via Settings; system default supported.

#### Performance notes

- Edge streaming chat enabled; SSE headers set via `@repo/shared`.
- TTS responses are cacheable; consider ETag if multiple voices are added.
- Images: No heavy images used; Next/Image not required currently.
- Bundle: App is minimal; consider splitting Explore import if it grows.

#### Mobile (Expo)

- Urbanist loaded; UI mirrors web theme. Placeholder updated to NovaX.
- Optional: add haptics for send button, dark-mode via Appearance.

#### Recommendations (next iteration)

- Add `PostHog` or similar with consent and anonymization.
- Add `i18next` integration or remove the dependency if unused.
- Add `idb-keyval` usage or remove if unused (currently unused).
- Add `robots.txt` and Open Graph metadata.
- Add unit tests for `@repo/ai` streaming, and visual regression tests.
- Implement `next-themes` if preferring SSR-friendly theme hydration.
- Add `aria-describedby` to textarea with character count helper.
- Consider replacing inline styles in layout nav with CSS class for maintainability.
